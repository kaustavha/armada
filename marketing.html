<h1>Welcome to the Armada cross platform application store</h1>
<p>Armada is an attempt to fix the fragmented application distribution landscape</p>
<br />
<p>Right now you have platform specific app stores, i.e one for windows, seperate one for android, tertiary one for macs</p>
<p> This made a lot of sense when we built platform specific apps. We had micrsoft office for windows and open office for linux. </p>
<p> But the app landscape has changed. It's more product focused and less platform focused. You build the best app for x for all platforms. For example, Evernote or Dropbox. Apps that have to run everywhere.</p>
<br />
<p>Developer tooling has also come a long way and is making great strides towards cross platform sdks e.g cordova, xamarin, node-webkit, atom-shell etc.</p>
<p>So why force developers to deal with the fragmented application marketplace? It's a breeze to generate a binary for each platform using cloud services but an expensive hassle pushing them to their designated app stores.</p>
<br />
<p>We present a solution:
  <br />
  Lets push our applications to a single cross platform app store instead. </p>
<p>
  One app store to rule them all.
